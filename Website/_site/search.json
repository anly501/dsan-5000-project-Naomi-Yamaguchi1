    "section": "Price Changes",
    "text": "Price Changes\nMedical expenses, when paid directly by patients, place a heavy burden on families with moderate to low incomes. Many individuals in the U.S. avoid medical care unless it’s absolutely necessary due to these costs. These expenses aren’t limited to medications; they encompass deductibles, co-pays, and any fees not covered by insurance. Often, co-pays can amount to $30-$50. Furthermore, medicines for rare diseases or unique health conditions have witnessed consistent price hikes annually. This results in reduced medication intake, putting many at risk of avoidable health complications or even death.\nElevated prices for prescription drugs pose a financial strain for both patients and the health care system. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) carried out a study to understand the trend in drug prices over time. In 2022, a noticeable spike in the cost of numerous drugs was observed, with an average increase of about $150 (10%) in January and $250 (7.8%) in July. Some medications experienced a staggering rise in prices, exceeding $20,000 or an increase of over 500%. Moreover, from July 2021 to July 2022, 1,216 products had price surges beyond the 8.5% inflation rate, averaging a hike of 31.6%. Data indicates that the ACA might not have a direct impact on the broader economy, which is why there’s an interest in examining its effects on the pharmaceutical sector and forecasting future prices."
