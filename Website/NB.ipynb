    "# Introduction to Naïve Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we are going to explore Naïve Bayes (NB)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview & Objective\n",
    "Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic classification method rooted in applying Bayes' theorem, with an emphasis on the \"naïve\" assumption of independence between features. This means that for the purpose of classification, each feature contributes independently to the probability of a particular class, regardless of the values of other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probabilistic Nature and Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Naïve Bayes estimates the posterior probability of a class given a set of features using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote $x$ as feature and $C_k$ as class. Formula can be written as: $$P(C_k|x) = \\frac{P(x|C_k) \\cdot P(C_k)}{P(x)}$$ Where: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $P(C_k|x)$ is the posterior probability of class $C_k$ given features x.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P(x|C_k)$ is the likelihood which the probability of features x given class $C_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P(C_k)$ is the prior probability of class $C_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P(x)$ is the prior probability of features x.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** $P(x)$ is constant for all classes, it's often omitted in practice, and the classification becomes about finding the class \n",
    "$C_k$ that maximizes the numerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives & Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of Naive Bayes classification is to determine the most probable class for a given instance based on its features. By leveraging the power of probability and statistics, the algorithm aims to provide an accurate and computationally efficient classification mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Naïve Bayes classification, we want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Predict the class of an instance based on its features with a high level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Offer a simple yet effective model, especially for datasets with many features or large datasets where other algorithms might be computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Handle both continuous and discrete data through its various variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variants of Naïve Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naïve Bayes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-Used when features are continuous and follow a Gaussian or normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-It assumes that the values associated with each class are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Choose Gaussian when dealing with continuous data that's normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multinomial Naïve Bayes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-Appropriate for discrete counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Often used for text classification where the features are the frequency of words (or n-grams) in documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Choose Multinomial when working with discrete data, especially in applications like text analytics where you're counting word occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bernoulli Naïve Bayes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-Works with binary/boolean features.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Useful in text classification tasks where features represent the presence or absence of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Choose Bernoulli for binary data, or when modeling binary features in datasets, such as \"word exists or not\" in text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Naïve Bayes is a versatile and probabilistic classification method offering simplicity and efficiency, especially in high-dimensional datasets. It's paramount to select the appropriate variant based on the nature of your data to ensure optimal results."

Analogous to our work in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we will utilize the IHE stock market dataset for the labeled records. For the textual data, we will extract information from the NewsAPI, which we interacted with in a prior lab session. Detailed descriptions and characteristics of these datasets can be found under the 'Small Data' and 'Large Data' tabs, respectively."

    "To enhance the preparation of record data for the Naive Bayes algorithm, we should begin by partitioning our dataset into training and testing subsets. This critical step not only facilitates a more robust training process but also sets the stage for subsequent model validation. Engaging in model validation is imperative as it provides a clear and empirical basis to assess the performance of our model, drawing insights from the results of our analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability in its predictive capabilities. By adopting this meticulous approach, we pave the way for a more effective and reliable implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm. Record data are using R code for analysis. "

Following this, akin to handling record data, our next steps involve partitioning this textual information into training and testing sets. This is a crucial step in our data preparation process for the Naive Bayes classifier. Post-segmentation, we proceed to transform the text data into a vectorized format, suitable for model ingestion. Having prepared our data, we then train the Naive Bayes model, ensuring to evaluate its performance rigorously to guarantee its predictive reliability. Finally, with confidence in our model's capabilities, we deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data, showcasing its practical applicability and robustness."

    "Examining the text dataset reveals a lack of numerical variables, necessitating a tailored approach for splitting it into training and testing sets. We aim for a 75-25 split, dedicating 75% to training and the remaining 25% to testing. Given that our dataset comprises text data and is not sequential like time series data, Python stands out as an apt choice for this task but kernel does not like to mix with R, so for a detailed guide on how to prepare and select features from text data, please refer to the tab labeled \"Feature Selection for Text Data,\" where comprehensive steps and practices are outlined to optimize your text data for machine learning models."
